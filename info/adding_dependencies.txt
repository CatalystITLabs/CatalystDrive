Adding Dependencies

Please note that there are 2 profiles of dependencies in this project:

1. Standalone container - "default"
2. External container - "externalContainer"

When adding dependencies for business logic, please remember to add them
to both profiles.

As a sidenote, when running a Run As... -> "maven build...", you can type in
the profile to use in the Profiles text box. Run configurations are already
made using the different profiles, however, and included with this project.
