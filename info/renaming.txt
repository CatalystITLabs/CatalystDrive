Renaming the Project

Altering the name of this application can be done in a few
easy steps:

1. Right click on the project and rename it.
2. In the project explorer choose the packages to be displayed
hierarchically (down arrow, upper right corner).  Right click
on the top level package and choose refactor -> rename.  Make sure
to check ALL the boxes in the prompt that appears.  Click OK
through the screens that follow.  (Do the same for the test
packages if you wish).
3. Go to the pom file.  
	a. Near the top of the file rename GroupId and 
	ArtifactId. 
	b. In the properties right below those, rename the 
	embeddedServerPath property to match the new package name.  
    c. Scroll down to the Jetty Plugin area and rename the contextPath.  
4. You may want to change the supplied run configurations also.  To do this, 
go to Run -> Run Configurations.  Click on each of the 3 run configurations associated
with this project and change the names as well as path to the project accordingly.
5. Once you have finished the steps above, PLEASE disassociate it from the 
CatalystTemplate project on svn.  You can do this by right clicking on the project -> 
Team -> Disconnect.  This will ensure the project is now disconnected from the
CatalystTemplate svn location.  At this point you can share it on svn as a new
project however you wish.
