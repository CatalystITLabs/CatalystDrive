Debug and Deployment

NOTE: You must use a Java 7, jdk 1.7.x with this project! (Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JRE's)

To debug:  run as -> maven build... -> for goals, type "jetty:run"
To deploy with standalone jetty server: 
	1. Go to Run As... -> Maven clean.  If this is a BIRT installation, this will remove temporary 
	BIRT folders as well as clean the target directory.
	2. Go to Run -> Run configurations -> run "CatalystTemplate - Create War for Standalone Jetty Server"
	3. Right click on extract_and_run.bat -> Open with... -> System Editor
	4. The .war will be extracted to c:\runnable-wars and the server will start up.  NOTE: This will only work 
	"as is" if your workspace is named "workspace".  If it is not named "workspace", you need to edit the .bat file 
	to reflect what your workspace is called.
To make a war for deploying on an external container like Tomcat:
	1. Go to Run -> Run configurations -> run "CatalystTemplate - Create War for External Container"
	2. Go to the target directory of the project, refresh the folder and copy the CatalystTemplate.war file
	to wherever the container needs the war.  E.G. for Tomcat, in the webapp directory of the Tomcat
	installation.
 
Notes:
1.  If you wish to use a different keystore, copy it into the keystore directory and change the keystore name and password 
	in EmbeddedJettyServer accordingly. The included keystore is unsigned.

By default for the standalone server, the path name will be "/CatalystDrive", both non-ssl and ssl will be "true", 
the port number, "8080", the ssl port number, "8443",  and the host name will be detected by the EmbeddedJettyServer 
(as your computer name on the network--NOT localhost).
