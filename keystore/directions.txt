KEYSTORE INFO:

The keystore in this directory is automatically copied as a resource and moved to the root of the war during a 'maven install' for use
by the EmbeddedJettyServer ssl deployment.  If you change the name and/or password of the keystore file please change
the fields in the EmbeddedJettyServer to match those.


To generate a new self-signed keystore run:
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore PATH/KEYSTORE_NAME -storepass KEYSTORE_PASS -validity 360 -keysize 2048

KEYSTORE_NAME and KEYSTORE_PASS correspond to the fields of the same names in EmbeddedJettyServer.java.  The PATH is the directory 
where the keystore will be placed by the keytool.
